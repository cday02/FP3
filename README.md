# About

Battalion 1944 Skins, is a single person Full-Stack eCommerce web application designed for learning purposes for the UT Austin Web Development bootcamp. Utilizing the MERN web application stack and more technologies to showcase my learning during the bootcamp.

## Goal

First and foremost this was an extremely valuable exercise that I used to demonstrate the skills I learned during the bootcamp. Doing the project by myself yielded pretty beneficial learning opportunities. I was able to dive into the areas of web development I didn't consider myself particularly strong in, and work on those skills to better define them. I'm proud of myself for accomplishing a Full-Stack application of this size by myself, as it allowed me to expand my working knowledge of web development as a whole.

## Things I would change.
After completing the project, and spending hours upon hours of working, I feel that I have a completely different understanding of development in general than when I first started. If I started the project over today, these are the things I would change:

 - I know have a better understanding of the Front-End component system react provides. I could have made a cleaner UI and probably added a few more features.
 - I would have added more interact-able routes.
 - Better organization of the database, and data stored.
 - Faster, clearer, cleaner code.
